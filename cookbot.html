      <h2>Problem Space</h2>
      <p> Why don't students or professionals cook more often?</p>

      <p> Growing up, my mom was always the most creative person when it came to cooking. No matter how little ingredients we had, she always made use of random ingredients to create the best meals.
          Now, entering my college years, I realized how challenging it was for myself and other young adults to make a variety of meals out of several ingredients. 
         
         After talking with my friends, I realized we all do the same thing: we get tired of eating the same thing because we're running out of time to find a new recipie and eventually end up going out to eat.

      </p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>Because there are numerous amount of reasons why people eat out, we wanted to focus on students that are on a budget, and preoccupied with classes, homework, extracurricular activities, along with working individuals that are concerend with their health and want to take control of what they put into their bodies. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
<p>After a casual surveys amongst friends and classmates, I noticed a common response about cooking: </p>      
      <ul>
        <li>not having enough time to plan </li>
        <li>don't know what to make</li>
        <li>bored of eating the same meals</li>
        <li>leftover ingredients from previous branching out</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Task Development</h3>
      <p>CookBot gives people the space to explore different recipes, but also discover recipes that use similar ingredients, preventing groceries from being wasted and cutting down on money that’s spent on buying one-use ingredients and eating out.
        </p>
        <p>App Features</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Customize the recipies based on your diet (vegetarian, gluten-free, kosher)</li>
                <li>Save your favorites, create lists on the app</li>
                <li>Add your ingredients and filter recipies based on it</li>
                <li>Creates shopping list</li>
                <li>Suggest ingredient replacements based on what you have</li>
              </ul>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Through my user research did not have usability testing, I learned many things that I wouldn't have figured out on my own without reaching out people during suveying. I realized that time and budget were huge factors in a person's diet, and effct the choices they make in terms of what to eat. To this project more efficient, I would make low fidelity mockups for a better demonstration of my idea. Overall, this was an experience to challenge my ability in researching and I believe I came out of this project knowing more, though I still plan to furtur my research and demonstration of the project.</p>
